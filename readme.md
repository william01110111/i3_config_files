# William's i3 config files

to get everything up and rinning, install the following packages:

* i3gaps (you must remove the gaps line in the config file to work with regular i3)
* lxpanel
* synapse

then clone this repo in ~/.config

remove any previous folder named i3 there and rename this folder to i3
